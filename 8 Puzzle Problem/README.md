# 8 Puzzle Problem 
The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3x3 grid with 9 blocks labeled 0 through 8, where the 0 represents a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they represent a particular order. The blocks can be moved horizontally or vertically into the blank square. 


Goal State in my code:

     1   2   3 
     8   0   4
     7   6   5


Input is expected in the form of 9 numbers from 0-8, representing the initial state of the board

Eg Input - 0 2 3 1 5 7 6 8 4    will represent:

     0   2   3
     1   5   7
     6   8   4
