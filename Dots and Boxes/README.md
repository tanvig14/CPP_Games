# Implementation of Dots and Boxes Game
This code has been written in SimpleCpp since the graphics needed to create the board to play the game were much easier to do in it.
The game can be played by 2 players against each other as well as 1 player vs the computer. Conditions have been set for the computer to play "smartly", i.e. it won't play completely randomly. If it sees a winning position it will take it and will prevent the player from winning if possible.

To install SimpleCpp on a linux system: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~cs101/2015.2/simplecpp%20installation%20slides%20in%20linux.pdf

To install SimpleCpp on a windows system: https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/frg/wiki/images/6/6d/Cygwin_Manual.pdf

Downloads for both are available on: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/

Once you execute the code, a blank canvas will appear. Go to the command prompt where you executed the program and provide input for the player names and board size, after which the game will appear on the canvas.

I have uploaded an executable version of the game to run on a windows machine as well!
