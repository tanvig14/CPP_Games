# Implementation of Dots and Boxes Game
This code has been written in SimpleCpp since the graphics needed to create the board to play the game were much easier to do in it.
The game can be played by 2 players against each other as well as 1 player vs the computer. Conditions have been set for the computer to play "smartly", i.e. it won't play completely randomly. If it sees a winning position it will take it and will prevent the player from winning if possible.

Bear in mind that my friends and I wrote this code in FY engineering for fun when we were just beginning to learn to code so I'm sure it can be optimized. Maybe I will someday, but it works just fine for now. You can create an executable of the code and share it with your friends to play.
